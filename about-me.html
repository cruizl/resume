    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I am Carlos Ruiz, a 26 year old--currently amateur-- web developer from
      Ecuador.

    <p>
      Funny enough, I went to medical school after high school and actually
      graduated as a Medical Doctor. Later on, after some difficult moments I
      decided I wanted to switch careers and move into a passion that I always
      had but never explored--web development
    </p>
    <p>
      During high school, I ran an indie tumblr blog about photography and
      clothes that I liked at the time. For some reason, the default themes
      Tumblr would offer felt like they lacked something, maybe a bit of my own
      touch. Eventually I started to find "code" for other themes I found over
      the internet and the time it all looked like gibberish to me. But that did
      not stop me.

      I started to delete stuff, move things around, see how the whole blog
      would be affected if I typed a couple words with weird symbols and I
      discovered I actually enjoyed getting stuff wrong and then trying again
      and getting them right. Playing with random keyboard strokes would add
      beauty and style to a collection of posts I already found absolutely
      pleasing to look at, and that felt glorious. Just thinking of doing stuff
      like that from a scratch, seemed impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      After medical school, I took some courses and realized that maybe it was
      not that difficult. So here I am, making a portfolio of the work that I
      made with so much love for you all to see. I hope you enjoye it.
